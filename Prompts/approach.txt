To choose the right prmoting technique, let's first understand the nature of problem that we are trying to get the GenAI to help with.
The problem: 
Design and architect an ecommerce website for selling shoes online.

Now, let's try to split this up into functional and non-functional requirements. 

Functional requirements are basically the business requirements or the features you want your website to have. These could include things such as User Login/Logout, Product Search page etc.
Non-functional requirements are those which are more on technical side but still can make an impact on your business. For example, the website up-time (e.g. 99.9% uptime), scalibility (how scalable your website is if you have a surge or unexpected volume.), performance (how responsive is your website, how much time it takes for search results to load up etc.).

Now, since this is an experiment and we are not actually designing a website, we are going to choose just 3 functional and non-functional requirements to focus on.

Functional Requirements:
1. User Login/Register page.
2. User landing page.
3. Product Search page.

Non-functional requirements:
1. High availability (website should be available 99.99% of the time).
2. Scalibility (architecture should be scalable enough to be able to handle traffic surges).
3. Performance (website pages such as product search page should not have response time of more than 2 secs).
