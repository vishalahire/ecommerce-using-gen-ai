# ecommerce-using-gen-ai
This repo attempts at experimenting with Chat GPT 3.5 for designing a website.

## Approach

Using prompt engineering and freely available tools such as ChatGPT 3.5, we will be attempting to design an ecommerce website for selling shoes online. This is an experiment to see whether we could use advanced prompt engineering techniques with GenAI tools to design and architect an ecommerce website. The reason for choosing ChatGPT 3.5 is because it is freely available and anyone can use it to replicate the experiment.

**Please note, this is strictly for experimentation and educational purposes and does not intend to indicate replacing Software Architecture jobs**
